    """Extract track details (name and artist) from a Spotify playlist.

    Fetches all tracks from a Spotify playlist and extracts their basic metadata
    (track name and primary artist) for use in search operations. Handles both
    regular playlists and the special "liked" playlist (user's Liked Songs).

    Args:
        sp: Authenticated Spotify client instance
        spotify_playlist_id: Spotify playlist ID or "liked" for Liked Songs

    Returns:
        List of dictionaries, each containing:
            - name: Track title
            - artist: Primary artist name

    Raises:
        SystemExit: If there's an error fetching the playlist or if no tracks
                   are found in the playlist

    Note:
        - Handles pagination automatically for large playlists
        - Skips tracks with missing metadata (name or artist)
        - For multi-artist tracks, only the first artist is included
        - Exits the program if the playlist is empty or inaccessible
