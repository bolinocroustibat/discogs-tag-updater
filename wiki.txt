Discogs Tag Updater
Writes Style description (in alphabetical order) + Original Year from the Master release on discogs.com to your FLAC + MP3 files in 1 go - batch mode style. (tag YEAR + GENRE will be altered)

This requires the artist and title tag to be set.

Why?
If you download a track from anywhere, their genres are often way too wide.
For example, you download a track and it says genre is Electro or Electronic or Dance. But it's actually Dubstep.

If you download a track from anywhere, and you didn't carefully watched from which album it is, You end up with the Year of the released album, not when the track was released. For example, you download a track and it's from a "Best Of The 90's" released in 2018. Then the track Year tag shows 2018. But in reality, the track was made somewhere in the 90's.

Why Discogs.com original year in the 1st place?
Because it grabs it from the Master release, meaning when the track appeared officially for the very 1st time. This way you make sure your collection shows a consistent timelined overview of the tracks that had this typical 70's, 80's , 90's, 00's etc. 'vibe'
