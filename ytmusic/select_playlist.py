    """
    Select a YouTube Music playlist for operations.

    Either uses a pre-configured playlist ID or prompts the user to select
    from their owned playlists. Supports special handling for "Liked Music".

    Args:
        ytm: Authenticated YTMusic client instance.
        playlist_id: Optional pre-configured playlist ID to use directly.
            If "LM", uses the user's Liked Music playlist.

    Returns:
        str: The selected playlist ID.

    Raises:
        Exception: If no playlists are found for the user.
        KeyboardInterrupt: If user cancels the selection process.
        Exception: If the specified playlist_id is invalid or inaccessible.

    Notes:
        If playlist_id is provided but invalid, the function falls back
        to interactive playlist selection. The "LM" playlist_id is
        a special case that refers to the user's Liked Music.
