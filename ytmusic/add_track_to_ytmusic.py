    Add a track to a YouTube Music playlist with retry logic for rate limits.

    Args:
        ytm: Authenticated YTMusic client instance.
        video_id: YouTube Music video ID to add.
        ytmusic_playlist_id: Target playlist ID, or "LM" for Liked Music.

        - Returns False if all retries fail or another error occurs.
        - Uses `rate_song` for Liked Music, `add_playlist_items` for regular playlists.
